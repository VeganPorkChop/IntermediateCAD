## CAD_PullCopter

### Description
I was student B. Student B was supposed to create the Spinner and Prop. Then both students would work on assembeling the whole thing.
### Evidence
[Onshape Doc Link](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/4dfdda2c1ff889c8dcbb4703/w/cb4eb8bae6270a91f983b4f1/e/7a28a22105602e994b2ce8f2).

### Reflection
The spinner easy, the helical curve I've never done before. The length is a variable, I didn't know that, dont keep increasing the rotational degree to try and make the length larger.
